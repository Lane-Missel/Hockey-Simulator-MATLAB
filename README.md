# Hockey-Simulator-MATLAB
Source code for a 3on3 hockey simulator.

This is where it all started.
This was my first 'project' that I started, after I realized that university lab assignments for my MATLAB course were too boring.

This source code has been the inspiration for the fully completed simulators that I have written in other languages.
